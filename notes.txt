what to do:
    Code:
        - pick on a configuration (penalty,depth, width, initialization, optimizer, learning rate)
        - exact or approximate likelihood? 
        - how much to coarsen data? GPUs?
    Paper:
        Simulations:
            Synthetic:
             - Outline is there, need to run once Code is done  
            NOAA sections:
                HRRR:
                    - section outine is basically done. What is missing?
                    - some discussion of the results?
                Goes-16:
                    - section outine is basically done. What is missing?
                    - need to discuss more about preprocessing
                    - converted geostationary to lambert conformal
                    - some discussion of the results?
                    - need to plot DMWs
        Methodology:
            Flows and Vector fields:
                 - Essentially finshed, edit for clarity
            Gaussian Process and Maximum likelihood:
                - Essentially finshed, edit for clarity
            Invertibility and Residual Networks:
                - Many notes saved based on different attempts. 
                - Wrap up once Code is done
            Vecchia and Optimization:
                 - Notes saved
                 - Wrap up once Code is done
        Introduction:
            Need to make more application driven
        
Help:
    - Can you look at similar papers and help with structure of simulations? 
    - Restructure the sections using place holder figures and tables?
